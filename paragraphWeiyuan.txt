I have learned so much from this project and my two amazing teammates. First, It was my first time to use Github which was super useful for me because I did not need to spend time on sending or asking codes from my teammates. Second, I had a better understanding of how gui works with other class modules such as plotting, database, and statistics. Third, the dot dot plots from 2000 to 2018 can tell us that a rapid drop in 2008. I googled it and found out it was due to the 2008 financial crisis of the world. In short, the project gave me a good introduction of working with people, making a sort of real application with gui, database, and network elements, and analysing data which could bring a surprising result.
