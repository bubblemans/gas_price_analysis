Lesson from this project:
It is important to analysis the topic and allocates the task to each individual. We had every clear job for each teammate, and we discussed when we had any issue that needs to collaborate and we helped each other to achieve the goal. We discussed how do we want to save records in the database so I could easily fetch data and save data from website. After I built the database, I asked other teammates how do they want to get the records so they could use the records from the database. Then, I created the class the help them to directly fetch data.  Also, I learned how to use a drop down button in the Tkinter. Luckily, my teammates are strong so we could do lots of work in the final project such as beautiful GUI, predict and mapping.
